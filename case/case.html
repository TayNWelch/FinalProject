      <p class="smalltext">The case of your PC is where you get the most customization but it is arguably the most
        important part as well. The case acts as armor, protecting all your components from damage. The case also helps
        maintain optimal temperatures so you get the most out of your parts.

      <p class="bigtext">Popular brands and their prices</p>
      <p class="smalltext">There no shortage of cases to choose from. Cases come in many different shapes, sizes,
        coolers
        and come with a range of features. If you can dream it, it has probably already been designed! This is the most
        fun part of building a PC so take your time and pick your case wisely.</p>

      <p class="bigtext">Other things to consider</p>
      <p class="smalltext">When it comes to picking out your PC case, you've got to think about a few things. First off,
        airflow and cooling are super important. You want a case that's got good ventilation, with space for fans or
        liquid cooling. Keeping your parts cool means they'll perform better.
        <br>
        <br>
        Make sure the case you're looking at can fit all your gear comfortably. That means checking if it can hold your
        motherboard, GPU, and any other extras you're planning on adding. You want something that's going to last, with
        solid construction and tough materials. A sturdy case not only protects your components but also looks better.
        <br>
        <br>
        Last but not least, don't forget about style. Your PC case is going to be sitting on your desk, so pick
        something
        that matches your vibe. Whether you're into sleek and modern or bold and flashy, find a case that speaks to you.
